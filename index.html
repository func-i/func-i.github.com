        <p>
          <span>Building complex technology has never been easier</span> than it is today. Or faster. This is a fundamental change that is accelerating and democratizing the creative process. Func-i is positioned to build interactive and mobile solutions that take advantage of this transformation. <!--while providing sound advice based on an entrepreneurial understanding our clients' goals.-->
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a history of successful partnerships built on the free exchange of creative ideas and brutal honesty. Together with our clients we build extraordinary businesses for the new web.
        </p>
        <h4>Read our Manifesto...</h4>

        <div id="manifesto">
          <h5>Creativity - We're all over the place:</h5>
          <p>Our creativity is built on the diversity of our team's backgrounds. Functional Imperative includes former high speed traders and wanna-be-rock-and-roll-stars; reformed intellectual property lawyers and Korean-taco restauranteurs; we have worked in international aid and international criminal law, and, of course, we are entrepreneurs. We have also lived and worked in dozens of countries on six continents. Unique solutions start with our unique way of thinking. And whether in finance or health, law or real-estate, we speak your language.</p>

          <h5>Got skills?</h5>
          <p>Together we have decades of coding experience across multiple verticals. We have resisted the urge to be generalists, and have focused our team's immense talent on a fixed technology stack. This expertise allows us to delve deeper and be trend setters, not followers. While we are focused on technology, our team also includes some of Canada's brightest talents in UX/UI and design. These team members mean we can not only make any idea an online reality but we can also make it frictionless and beautiful too.

          <p>Our capabilities include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Business analysis and information architecture</li>
              <li>Interactive web development</li>
              <li>Responsive design and user experience</li>
              <li>Native and HTML5 mobile development</li>
              <li>Social media integration and deployment</li>
              <li>Cloud-based infrastructure management</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>


          <h5>An in-person relationship</h5>
          <p>While we have immense respect for the incredible wealth of talent overseas, we feel there is nothing like a long chat over strong coffee or a scotch to ensure that we build what you want the way you want it built. Because great solutions begin with a thorough understanding of the problem, we start by asking a lot of questions. In response, we often feel compelled to provide a blunt and transparent perspective on your business model. This assessment provides a basis for us to explore, together, whether and how Functional Imperative's software and design services can work for you. This process is meant to build trust, which is fundamental to any successful relationship and something that can never be off-shored.</p>

          <h5>Bespoke, Agile, Business-Smart, Meticulous</h5>
          <p>Founded and staffed by recovering entrepreneurs, we are as passionate about building outstanding products that solve real-world problems as you are about your business. We take advantage of the latest advances in technology and startup methodologies to build enterprise-scale software efficiently and with unparalleled attention to detail. Our focus on launching early and iterating often helps you validate your ideas and and build better products. Our cutting-edge sites are the result of our passion for technology, design and pushing the limits of functionality.</p>
