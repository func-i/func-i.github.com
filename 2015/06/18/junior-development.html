                <p>I&#39;ve trained a number of Junior Developers, mostly out of Bootcamps.  In fact, the owners of Functional Imperative have also founded
a coding school in Toronto called <a href="http://lighthouselabs.ca">Lighthouse Labs</a>.  So I expect that I&#39;ll be training even more Junior Developers.</p>

<h2>Juniors</h2>

<p>They say a US Marine&#39;s head is like an empty jar, he only knows what you put in (Jarhead).  This does and doesn&#39;t apply to a new programmer.</p>

<p>Their main task is solving problems!  They do this in code, but how they <em>think</em> and what steps they take when solving problems 
is affected by personality and previous life experiences.  We can give them structure and coach their thought process, but each Junior Developer is as unique as the next.</p>

<h3>Hurdles</h3>

<p>We do a lot of work in Rails and AngularJS, and anyone who has used these two frameworks knows that there is a <em>Rails</em> way or an <em>Angular</em> way to write code.
A big problem throughout a programmer&#39;s career is that you &quot;don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t know.&quot;
What I mean by that is that if there is an accepted solution or library that is always used for this problem and you aren&#39;t aware of it, you might start trying to write
code to solve the problem yourself rather than leverage the existing solution.  This is quickly followed by a facepalm when you learn the solution existed the whole time.
It&#39;s hard to know about tools and best practices that you haven&#39;t been exposed to.</p>

<p>So a general rule I tell juniors is that they are not going to do anything that people haven&#39;t already done and solved before.
If they find themselves in a situation where they are completely blocked and start blaming the tools (we all have), the problem
is likely they are doing something wrong or there is a better way.  No hacks needed by them just yet!</p>

<h3>20 min rule</h3>

<p>This brings us to the <strong>20 min</strong> rule.  In our dev shop we have a rule that if you&#39;re completely stuck for more than 20 mins, you ask for help.
Even if it&#39;s just for a second opinion, or to talk your problem out.  After 20 mins, you get help rather than get blocked or frustrated for an extended period of time.</p>

<p>This promotes discussion, it catches hacky solutions early, and it gives juniors an opportunity to learn from more experienced developers as often as possible.</p>

<h3>Make mistakes</h3>

<p>If a Junior Dev wants to implement a solution that I know will not work (I have the benefit of experience), 
I talk to them about it and hint at potential problems, if they still want to go ahead with their implementation.  I let them!</p>

<p>The benefit of them learning from their mistakes is tremendous, that&#39;s how I learned.  Of course this is a controlled process so I can peel them back
when the time is right, but they are better for it in the end.</p>

<h2>Intermediates</h2>

<p>So you&#39;ve been coding for over a year now, you&#39;ve done some cool stuff and learned 2 or more languages on 2 or more frameworks.
You can be productive and contribute to any project you are put on.  Congratulations you have made it past the &quot;First Gate&quot; and eliminated doubt in yourself.  (a <em>&quot;The Neverending Story&quot;</em> reference)</p>

<h3>Where do we go from here?</h3>

<p>To a lower level!  There are a lot of tools out there these days, and they do a lot of wonderful things for you.
I find a lot of intermediates that learned to code from day 1 using these tools have taken for granted all the lower level things that are being done for them, and they don&#39;t go out of their way to close that gap.</p>

<p>Should every web developer know SQL really well?  The quick answer is <strong>of course!</strong> How could that be a bad thing?</p>

<p>Does every web developer know SQL really well?  Unfortunately no.</p>

<p>If you learned to interact with the database using an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM</a>, chances are your SQL skills aren&#39;t up to scratch.  You want to get to the next level, go and learn SQL really really well.  (Triggers, SPs (PG/PLSQL), Views, etc)</p>

<p>There are a number of areas where this can apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>security</li>
<li>server deployment and sysadmin</li>
<li>front-end optimizations</li>
<li>writing data driven reports</li>
<li>more thorough testing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Responsibility</h3>

<p>Eventually as you get better, you will be tasked with training others.  This is a natural progression in the programming industry.
Use this opportunity to organize your coding process so that others can learn by example.
Determine important parts of a project that different people can work on, (get a better understanding of the project and your coworkers).
Improve your communication skills as you help explain different concepts and ideas.
Contribute to all aspects of the projects and learn from all the challenges.</p>

<p>Pay it forward.  </p>
